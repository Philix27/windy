- User verifies phone umber using masa
- Masa sends an otp
- Then waits for verification of otp
- After which a wallet address is returned
- This wallet address is used to query the smart contract
- Which stores the user's info as an ipfs on a decentralized database
- This signed in user can then create and publish a post
- post is saved on the database with users's wallet address
-
